This repository maintains the JSON format data of open source Projects of Interests (POI) for the BeSecure(BeS) community. The use of this datastore allows the [BeSLighthouse](https://github.com/Be-Secure/BeSLighthouse) dashboard to visualize community-tracked details.

Individual version summaries for each project are available within the version_details directory. To track a new project in [Be-Secure](https://github.com/Be-Secure/Be-Secure), add the project entry into the OSSP_Master.json file and create a new file for the version summary within the version_details directory.

The community-provided [BeSecure Contributor Toolkit](https://github.com/Be-Secure/besecure-developer-toolkit) will generate the metadata for the tracking of new projects.
